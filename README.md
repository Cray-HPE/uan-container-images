# UAN Container Images Repo

This repos provides container images for User Access Instances (UAI)s.  These images are used in conjunction with K3s on UAN(s) to provide isolated lightweight disposable login environmnents for users.

### Basic Minimal SLES-15 UAI Image

HPE ships a basic UAI Image that can be used to create UAIs mostly for sanity testing purposes.  This UAI Image provides a minimal login environment used to demostrate that UAIs are working prior to the creation and deployment of custom UAI images by the site.
